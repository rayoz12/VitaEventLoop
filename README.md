# Hiatus
This project is on hold. The Vita doesn't provide any Async File API's and file descriptors between the network and file Sony Modules are completely different. A lot of code would have to be rewritten to accomodate for this. Eventually this will get done, but I'm more so hoping for a better platform (Switch) to develop on that supports this Async API's out of the box. I've already read the toolchain for the Switch and it looks miles better.
